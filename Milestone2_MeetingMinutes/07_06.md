# H13A ECHO Meeting Minutes
## 06/07/2021
### Start: 2:25pm End: 5:00pm

### Agenda
* Create code stubs
* Work out basic methods and attributes required in each class
* Update UML Diagram

### What has been done beforehand:
* Starter Code has been refactored
* Start Code Methods have been mostly generalised:
  * LoadSword, Sword -> LoadItem, Item
    * Sword is a Weapon which is an Item
  * LoadVampireCastleCard, VampireCastleCard -> LoadCard, Card
    * VampireCastleCard is a Card which contains the VampireCastleBuilding

### What has been discussed:
* Battles work by having an Entity attack another Entity
* MovingEntity = a base class which we can use to implement multiple things
  * Has hp, atk, def, crit chance, pathPosition
  * These are all used by enemies and the Character
  * Ally is a MovingEntity which doesnt move!
    * uses MovingEntity as a base for hp and attacking
* BattleBehaviours should use strategy pattern:
  * There is a BasicBattle behaviour with normal attack and crit attacks
  * ZombieBattle behaviour wraps around any base BattleBehaviour, but critAttacks zombify Enemies
    * CHANGE FROM SPEC: From zombifying allies -> zombifying any friendly entitites in battle
    * If there was a friendly slug, that slug would become a zombified slug
    * Zombified Vampire would crit by zombifying the target, and then apply the vampire debuff!
* Battlebehaviour.attack() & Battlebehaviour.recieveAttack():
  * .attack() applies the entity's attack into the target's .recieveAttack() method
  * .receiveAttack(just performs the math to mitigate damage based on defence)
  * these methods are differnet for the character, whom has to calculate the effects items have on it
* Item's methods
  * Weapons need an attack(Enemy) method

#### LoopMania Patch Notes:

* New class: Status!
  * Moving Entities could be afflicted with a Status
  * Statuses include:
    * Zombified
    * VampireDebuff
    * Trance: CHANGE FROM SPEC:
      * Instead of turning into an ally, makes an enemy friendly, which keeps its skillset
  * Since any MovingEntity could be afflicted with a Status, we can have tranced friendly zombies, or zombified vampires,
  * or tranced zombified vampires!
